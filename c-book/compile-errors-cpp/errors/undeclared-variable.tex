\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
void loopUpToN(int n) {
  while (i < n) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\errmsg{'i' undeclared (first use in this function)}

This error means that the compiler doesn't know what a term means.  This is often because you are trying to use a variable without declaring it.

In Example \ref{ex:undeclared-variable} we can see that the \code{i} variable was undeclared.
We can fix this by adding \code{int i = 0;} before the \keyword{while} loop.

\begin{figure}
\begin{lstlisting}
bool shouldContinue(char response) {
  return response == 'y' || response == Y;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\errmsg{'Y' undeclared (first use in this function)}
\label{ex:unquoted-char}
\end{figure}

In Example \ref{ex:unquoted-char} the same error actually has a different cause.
Here, we forgot the single quotes around the character \code{'F'} so the compiler thinks that \code{F} is a variable rather than a character constant.
This can be fixed by adding the missing quotes.
