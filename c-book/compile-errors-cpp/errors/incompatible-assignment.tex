This error means that you are attempting to assign a variable of one type with an expression of a different type.
In this case, the problem is that you forgot to get the address of \code{n} with the address-of operator \code{\&}, so it is trying to assign a \code{double} to a \code{double*} variable.

This error is similar to an incompatible initialization (Section \ref{sec:incompatible-initialization}) except in that case you are trying to initialize a variable rather than assign it a new value.
