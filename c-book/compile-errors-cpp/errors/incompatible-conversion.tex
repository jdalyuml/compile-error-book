This warning means that you are attempting to assign an integer value to a pointer, which is a different type.
In this case, the problem is that you forgot to get the address of \code{n} with the address-of operator \code{\&}.

This is similar to initializing with a compatible type (Section \ref{sec:incompatible-initializing}).
There is a conversion from \code{int}s to pointers, but it is not recommended (hence the warning).
