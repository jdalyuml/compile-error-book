This error means that you are attempting to initialize a variable of one type with an expression of a different type.
In this case, the problem is that you forgot to get the address of \code{n} with the address-of operator \code{\&}, so it is trying to assign a \code{double} to a \code{double*} variable.

This error is similar to both the incompatible integer to pointer conversion (Section \ref{sec:incompatible-conversion}) and assigning from an incompatible type (Section \ref{sec:incompatible-assignment}).
In the former case, \code{int}s have a special conversion to a pointer, but using it is discouraged, so a warning is generated instead.
In the latter case, you are assigning it a new value rather than initializing it.
