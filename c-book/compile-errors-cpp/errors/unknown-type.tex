In C and C++, types need to be defined before they can be used.
This error message means that the compiler cannot find the type indicated.
This can be fixed in a couple different ways.
If the type is defined in another file, you can \code{\#include} the header file that defines it.
If the type exists under a different name, you can use the \keyword{typedef} keyword to rename it.
Finally, in C++ you can define a \keyword{class} of the given type.
