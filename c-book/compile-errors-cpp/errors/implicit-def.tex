#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  printHouse();
}

void printHouse(void) {
  printf("/ \\\n");
  printf("|_|\n");

\end{lstlisting}
\warnmsg{implicit declaration of function 'printHouse'; did you mean `printf'? [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]}
\label{ex:missing-dec}
\end{figure}

This error message means that you have called a function that has not been declared yet, but will be declared later in the program.
In Example \ref{ex:missing-dec} this can be solved by adding a function declaration for \func{printHouse} before the \func{main} function (or in a header file that we include).  This example will also cause a conflicting types error (Section \ref{sec:conflicting-types}) because the compiler assumes that the implicitly defined function has type \keyword{int} but the actual implementation is \keyword{void}.
